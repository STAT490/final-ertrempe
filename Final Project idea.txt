My project idea is to scrape text from NBA scouting reports to compare All-Star players to non All-Star players. People who oppose the use of sports analytics often cite the existence of intangible traits in athletes that do not show up in box scores and stat sheets. These traits instead are captured by the "eye test" which would not show up in traditional analytics. These evaluations are often done by scouts, and though they do not show up in statistics, they are recorded in text in scouting reports. Text analysis seems like a good way to capture these intangible traits to give sports analytics a more complete picture of all the things that really impact the performance of players and the results of games. I will likely choose scouting reports from one draft class years ago and then subset the data into an All-Star group and a non All-Star group. I could potentially also separate those players who were categorized as "busts" where they did not pan out as professional players at all, but this could be harder to subset as there are not clear lines between successful and unsuccessful careers. These scouting reports are available on the Draft Express website for scraping. An example, for the player Dwyane Wade, is found at the link: http://www.draftexpress.com/profile/Dwyane-Wade-4726/.
