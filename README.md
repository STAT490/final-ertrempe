This is the repo for your final project in STAT 490. We will work in this repo for a number of weeks. 
The first step is to add a file with an idea (or multiple ideas!) for your final project. 
Please do this before class Thursday, April 7.
Please note, I would like you to comment on your peers' initial ideas, so eventually I will be adding access to this repo for other people.
